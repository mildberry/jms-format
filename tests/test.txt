<h2><b>Does all the discipline advice out there seem impossible?</b></h2>
<p data-paragraph-id="1">You’re <i>supposed</i> to do this. Or you’re <i>not</i> supposed to do that. </p>
<p data-paragraph-id="2">And here’s the kicker: when your child is acting up and you try the latest advice, it just doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to. So what are you doing wrong?</p>
</div>
<div><div><blockquote>The truth is, most classic parenting approaches don’t work for a lot of children.</blockquote></div></div>
<div><p data-paragraph-id="3">Each child is unique. So a one-size-fits-all approach just creates frustration. Stop making this simple mistake and you’ll start eliminating frustration today. </p></div>
<div>
<h2><b>The biggest discipline mistake </b></h2>
<p data-paragraph-id="4">The biggest  mistake is disciplining a child contrary to their nature. </p>
<p data-paragraph-id="5">When we approach children contrary to their nature, they often react negatively. Adults then react to a child’s negative reaction with disciplinary tactics to try and get them to comply. They just go around and around in a cycle of frustration that doesn’t work. </p>
<p data-paragraph-id="6">When you honor your child’s true nature, discipline takes on another look because it’s supportive to your children. They are more cooperative and responsive to discipline that honors them.</p>
<h2><b>What do I mean discipline them true to their nature? </b></h2>
<p data-paragraph-id="7">Each child is born into this world with a unique nature and level of energy. In my work with children, I have discovered 4 basic types of children who express similar tendencies in their body language, behavior, and personality:</p>
<p data-paragraph-id="8">—The Fun-loving Type 1 Child: Naturally buoyant and random, these children have a gift for ideas.</p>
<p data-paragraph-id="9">—The Sensitive Type 2 Child: Naturally subdued and connected, these children gather details and make plans.</p>
<p data-paragraph-id="10">—The Determined Type 3 Child: Naturally swift and active, these children push things forward.</p>
<p data-paragraph-id="11">—The More Serious Type 4 Child: Naturally logical and analytical, these children perfect the world around them. </p>
<p data-paragraph-id="12">As a parent, you have an intuitive understanding of your child. These 4 Types are just a tool to help you understand your children’s tendencies even more clearly. </p>
<p data-paragraph-id="13">Knowing your child’s type will help you create a more mutually cooperative relationship. </p>
<h2><b>Discipline for different Types of children </b></h2>
<p data-paragraph-id="14">Let’s look at a typical parenting approach: Time Out. </p>
<p data-paragraph-id="15">A fun-loving<b> Type 1</b> child as described in The Child Whisperer system is naturally social. A long, solitary time-out for this child feels like a day of torture. Given their high energy, they’re not likely to just sit still anyway. </p>
<p data-paragraph-id="16">A more serious <b>Type 4 </b>child has a still, reflective nature. Their movement is lower. In fact, if you send a <b>Type 4 </b>to time-out (especially if it’s in their room), it may actually feel like a reward.
If you need to discipline a child, do it in a way that honors their true nature…</p>
<p data-paragraph-id="17">—Turn cooperation into a game for a fun-loving<b> Type 1</b> child.</p>
<p data-paragraph-id="18">—Speak gently and reassure a sensitive <b>Type 2 </b>child.</p>
<p data-paragraph-id="19">—Give that determined <b>Type 3 </b>child a motivating challenge.</p>
<p data-paragraph-id="20">—Make discipline a private experience for a more serious <b>Type 4</b> child.</p>
</div>
<div><div><blockquote>All 4 types of children will respond well when their needs are met and voices heard.</blockquote></div></div>
<div>
<h2><b>Skip the advice—customize your parenting </b></h2>
<p data-paragraph-id="21">Stop trying to sort through all the advice of what you <i>should</i> do and start doing what your child’s already telling you will work. </p>
